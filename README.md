# SungWeather

SungWeather is an iOS project inspired by Samsung's calculator app
which is currently not available for iOS. In this project, the UI
is constructed in a way to resembled Samsung's app as much as possible.

Currently the beautiful and simplistic UI has been completed and looks
almost identical to Samsung's calculator. 

Still a work in progress, many new features are being added constantly in the hopes
to bring one of the best calculators to iOS!
